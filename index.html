    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Hi, I'm Lokesh — Results-driven Microsoft 365 Engineer with extensive experience in Exchange Online, Defender and Purview products. Proven expertise in deploying, managing, and troubleshooting complex Exchange Online environments while implementing robust security measures to safeguard organizational data. Strong problem-solving abilities and excellent communication skills, dedicated to providing exceptional support and driving continuous improvement.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a Messaging Specialist at <a href="https://www.cibc.com" target="_blank">CIBC</a>, I play a central role in maintaining a highly available and stable Microsoft 365 messaging environment, with a strong focus on email security, hygiene, and archiving across both cloud and on‑premises systems. My day‑to‑day responsibilities include proactive monitoring, incident response, and participation in disaster recovery drills, where I help incorporate lessons learned into future strategies.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ve successfully led several large‑scale initiatives, including designing and implementing mail‑flow rerouting for over <strong>70,000</strong> users, automating the purge of sensitive emails for more than <strong>14,000 accounts</strong>, and migrating <strong>4,000+ mailboxes</strong> to meet strict data residency regulations. To further strengthen resiliency, I deployed <strong>air‑gapped, immutable backups</strong> and introduced <strong>ProofPoint</strong> Continuity to ensure uninterrupted email communications during outages. I’ve also integrated multiple applications with secure Graph APIs, enhancing both reliability and security across the environment. Through these projects, I’ve helped CIBC reduce operational risk, improve compliance, and ensure that critical communication systems remain secure, resilient, and efficient at enterprise scale.
    </p>
    <p>
      At <a href="https://www.sherweb.com/" target="_blank">SherWeb Inc.</a>, I had the opportunity to work directly with a wide range of clients/enterprises, helping them navigate the complexities of Microsoft 365. My role went far beyond troubleshooting — it was about building trust and ensuring that organizations could fully leverage the Microsoft ecosystem. I supported environments that spanned Exchange Online, Microsoft Defender, Purview, Azure Information Protection, Intune, Azure Identity, and SharePoint/OneDrive or Teams, often stepping in to resolve high‑priority issues under tight deadlines.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the highlights of my time there was being recognized as Most Valuable Player (MVP) twice within a team of more than 100 advisors. This recognition reflected not only my technical expertise but also my commitment to SherWeb’s values of collaboration, accountability, and continuous improvement. I consistently shared knowledge with colleagues, mentored newer team members, and contributed to refining internal processes so the entire team could deliver faster, more reliable support.
    </p>
    <p>
      These experiences gave me a deep understanding of how Microsoft 365 products interact in real‑world environments, and how to balance technical precision with clear, client‑focused communication. It was a role that sharpened both my problem‑solving skills and my ability to translate complex technical issues into solutions that made sense for business leaders and IT teams alike.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a graduate of <a href="https://flemingcollege.ca/" target="_blank">Sir Sandford Fleming College</a> with a Post-Graduate Certificate in Wireless Information Networking program, I focused on wireless protocols, network security, and enterprise infrastructure. With my certificate of <a href="https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/b414cbb8-e886-48b3-8abf-9de14ab3e138/linked_in_profile">CCNA (Cisco Certified Network Associate) </a>and CCENT ICND1 (Interconnecting Cisco Network Devices), I developed a strong foundation in TCP/IP, routing, and switching, and completed lab‑based projects involving Cisco hardware and network simulations. This program sharpened both my technical and analytical skills, preparing me for real‑world IT environments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having worked as a Lab Assistant for the course Interfacing in my Post Graduate Certificate program, I had an opportunity to help students understand programming codes, debug them, and make them understand how to troubleshoot and solve errors in the code. I also helped them assemble and test the electronic kits of the lab and cleaned out the useless files and folders after the lab was done.
    </p>
    <p>
      My previous experience as a Jr. Engineer in Infinium India Ltd. helped me grow my interest in networking as I worked on a 'Network Management System' project which was a small network created to handle equipment used in satellite communication.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accomplished Bachelor's of Engineering in Electronics and Telecommunication.
    </p>
    <p>
      Love to solve any problem, especially with complex scenarios. Absolutely efficient for working on multiple projects. My hobbies are traveling, learning something new, and cooking.
