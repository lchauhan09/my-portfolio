                    <li>Bees tend to die in a harsh climate like that in Canada and thus the need of the project. Led a
                        team of
                        four, collected vital information from the bee-hive such as temperature & humidity and captured

                    <li>Using Raspbian OS on RaspberryPi, created a Python script to capture temperature and humidity
                        from
                        sensor DHT22 in a CSV format file which was then analyzed to generate a report and create alerts
                        with a
                        Shell script to take photographs and automated it to run every hour.</li>
                    <li>The CSV data was represented in Excel and graphs were made through the information for easy
                        visualization for the end user, everything being updated in real-time and notification alarm set
                        to take
                        preventive measures.</li>

                    <li>All these data can be managed wirelessly in an internal network through an access point, by
                        OpenVPN on
                        any platform like Windows, MacOS, Android, iOS.</li>
